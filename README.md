# AGN Spectra Project

## Project Overview
The AGN Spectra project was undertaken to study Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and determine the mass of the black hole using AGN data. This project aimed to explore the spectral properties of AGN and investigate their implications in understanding the physics of black holes.

## Project Details
Start Date: January 1, 2023
End Date: June 30, 2023

## Project Team
Mentor: Imtiaz Ahmed (SUST-PHY)
Research and Project Secretary: Sakibul Islam Rayhan
Assistant Research and Project: Nusrath Jahan Milie

## Team Members:
KM Shariat Ullah (SUST-EEE)
Nusrath Jahan Milie (SUST-PHY)
Sakibul Islam Rayhan (SUST-EEE)
Rahul Dev Sharma (SUST-PHY)

## Objectives
The main objectives of the AGN Spectra project were:

1. Analyze AGN spectra to identify characteristic features.
2. Investigate the correlation between spectral properties and black hole mass.
3. Develop methodologies for estimating black hole mass based on AGN observations.
4. Contribute to the understanding of AGN physics and black hole properties.

## Achievements
Throughout the project duration, the team accomplished the following:

1. Analyzed a large sample of AGN spectra to extract key information.
2. Conducted statistical analyses to explore the relationship between spectral properties and black hole mass.
3. Worked on a novel method for estimating black hole mass using AGN data.
4. Contributed to the existing knowledge of AGN physics and their implications in black hole studies.

## Conclusion
The AGN Spectra project provided valuable insights into the mass estimation of black holes using AGN data. The findings of this project contribute to the ongoing research on AGN physics and further our understanding of black hole properties. The dedication and hard work of the project team, guided by the mentor, have been instrumental in achieving the project's objectives.
